## About this Repository

This repository provieds content for the legacy **Optimization Shell Inverse**'s web pages at [ajgorhoe.github.io/Inverse/](http://ajgorhoe.github.io/Inverse/). Some sub-pages are:
* A Ph.D. thesis repated to Inverse: [A General Purpose Computational Shell for Solving Inverse and Optimisation Problems](https://ajgorhoe.github.io/Inverse/doc/phd/index.html)
* [Inverse Manuals](https://ajgorhoe.github.io/Inverse/doc/man/index.html)

*Inverse* is a flexible software for performing engineering optimization tasks in conjunction with numerical simulation software, written mainly in C.
