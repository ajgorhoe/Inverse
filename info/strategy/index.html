<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optimization shell <i>Inverse</i> has undergone
the first development stage where the basic framework for
implementation
tools have been developed. It is now in the stage where algorithms and
tools for performing different tasks and solving various kinds of sub
problems
are added and improved. New tools will be mostly responsible for
changing
the programme look, although some conceptual things will be the subject
of change and upgrade, too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many things we would like to do in the
future. <i>Inverse</i> tends to be a programme offering <b>tools for
various
optimization areas</b> such as shape optimization, optimization of
systems
with noisy response, etc.&nbsp; We would not like to limit <i>Inverse</i>
to the use with a single simulation programme or to solution of a
specific
type of problems. One of the basic ideas of the shell is generality. It
should in the first place provide general tools commonly needed for
solution
of optimization problems, e.g. optimization algorithms or functions for
matrix manipulation. On the top of this it should provide a framework
for
implementation of tools for solution of specific sub problems (e.g.
domain
transformation for shape optimization problems and interfacing routines
for utilization of simulation programmes).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the objectives for the future is to
provide
<i>Inverse</i>
as an <b>open library</b>.&nbsp; Different research groups will then
be
able to implement their own tools in <i>Inverse</i> independently on
the
<i>Inverse</i>
development team. Modules developed in different research and
development
groups can this way be distributed without interference of <i>Inverse</i>
development team. We hope that gradually this would create variety of
tools
that users could obtain from different sources and plug into <i>Inverse</i>.
The <i>Inverse</i> team will however still develop its own tools which
will be a part of the shell by default. We want to provide a set of
most
basic tools to cover common needs, but also leave peak experts in
individual
areas to offer their more advanced and specialized solutions as a
supplement
to the basic scheme.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a similar way we would like to spread a circle
of simulation codes that would provide a <b>close interface</b> with <i>Inverse</i>.
All users of these codes would have, regardless to the simulation code
they use, opportunity to take the advantage of what <i>Inverse</i>
offers,
essentially of a variety of tools developed not only by the <i>Inverse</i>
team. <i>Inverse</i> comes with a general file interface, which
enables
use of <i>Inverse</i> with practically every code that uses text input
and output. However, direct interface between the shell and a
simulation
programme is more elegant, efficient and easy to use. Besides, the
structure
of many simulation programme is not suited wery well for optimization.
Creation of a direct interface with <i>Inverse</i> can improve that. <i>Inverse</i>
team will provide assistance to the simulation code developers who
would
like to provide a direct interface with <i>Inverse</i>. The <b>expertise
of the whole <a href="http://www.c3m.si">C3M</a> group</b>, a part of
which
is doing research in advanced finite element code concepts, can be
employed
here.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Development tasks</b> that currently have the
highest priority are the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Optimization algorithms</b><font size="-1"> - the FSQP
represents the
strongest optimization engine of the shell. It serves wery well for
identification
of local minima when the objective function is enough smooth and the
level
of noise is not too high. In the future the shell will have to provides
efficient algorithms for problems for which standard algorithms don't
perform
well, e.g. statistical optimization methods. Implementation of such
algorithms
can generate additional demands on shell concepts which <i>Inverse</i>
development team will have to meet. The beginning stage of
incorporating
new kinds of algorithms will be crucial for identifying such demands.</font></li>
  <li>
    <b>Open library</b><font size="-1"> - this will enable independent
development
of additional modules outside the <i>Inverse</i> development team.
Basic
task will be development of library functions which will support
complete
integration of newly developed modules with the existent shell
functionality.</font></li>
  <li>
    <b>Parallelisation</b><font size="-1"> - the parallel interface
will provide
the framework for implementation of&nbsp; parallel optimization
algorithms.</font></li>
  <li>
    <b>Facilities for processing results, including graphics</b><font
 size="-1">
- standard data formats will be provided for representation of
optimization
results, which include not only the optimal parameter set and function
values, but also optimization path. These structures will be generated
by optimization algorithms, while the user will be able to customize
the
structures and output the data in various formats which will enable
additional
processing by external programmes. A graphic module will provide
graphical
interpretation of data in the standard format.</font></li>
  <li>
    <b>Auxiliary tools</b><font size="-1">, e.g. matrix manipulation or
supporting
tools for shape optimization, will be continuously developed.</font></li>
  <li>
    <b>Integration with simulation programmes<font size="-1"> </font></b><font
 size="-1">will
not only make use of <i>Inverse</i> with specific simulation
programmes
easier, but will also accumulate knowledge about demands on the
structure
of simulation software from different areas that arise from
optimization.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Inverse</i> development has depended much
on <b>funding</b> granted for research. This source will not suffice
in
the future, therefore we will send the programme to <b>market</b>.
With
the additional source of income generated by commercial distribution we
will try to build a research and development team which will be up to
meeting
the most demanding user needs.
