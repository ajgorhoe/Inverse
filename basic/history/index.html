<p><br><b><i><a href="http://www.c3m.si/staff/gresovnik.html">Igor Gresovnik</a></i></b>
began to develop <i>Inverse</i> in spring 1994 while finishing his final
degree at C3M and <a href="http://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/indexa.html">Faculty
of Mathematics and Physics</a>, <a href="http://www.uni-lj.si/DefaultA.asp">University
of Ljubljana</a>. His idea was to gather various tools and algorithms for
solving optimization and <i>Inverse</i> problems in an organised environment,
which would provide methods for interaction with simulation programmes
and a flexible user interface.
<p>The first version of the programme was completed in May 1994. It included
a small collection of optimization algorithms and a line file interpreter,
which served as a user interface. The programme communicated with a simulation
programme through simple files with pre-defined syntax. <a href="http://rsazure.swan.ac.uk/">Rockfield
Software's</a> finite element based programme <i><a href="http://rsazure.swan.ac.uk/products/elfen/elfen.html">Elfen</a></i>
was used for simulations. It was adapted case-to-case for use with the
shell so that it printed the required final data in a specified format
to the interface files. Since then <i>Inverse</i> have been intensively
used on
<a href="http://www.c3m.si">C3M</a> <a href="http://www.c3m.si/projects.html">research
projects</a> such as COST 512 - MMSP, BRITE/EURAM - PREDWEAR, BRITE/EURAM
- SOFT, BRITE/EURAM - FATLIFE, COPERNICUS - WEAR, as well as for solution
of industrial problems. Experience gained on these applications has strongly
inspired the course of <i>Inverse</i> development.
<p>The following development period was mostly devoted to improvement of
the user interface and interface with the simulation programme. In November
1994 version 1.0 was finished. A system for evaluation of mathematical
expressions (also referred to as "expression evaluator" or simply "calculator")
was developed and more flexible command interpreter, which allowed flow
control, replaced line interpreter. Initially awkward framework so developed
into a programme that fitted the basic idea quite well.
<p>In April 1995 version 2.0 was finished. This was an improved version
1.0, which included a complete file interface with the simulation programme
Elfen. This suppressed the need to interfere with Elfen source code at
the solution of specific cases.
<p>In October 1996 version 2.5 was finished. Basic gain was a set of functions
for accessing global pre-defined variables of the shell. Typical interlaced
structure with unlimited data exchange between individual modules was established.
Such structure became more obvious in version 2.7 (finished in July 1997)
in which the concept of user-defined global variables (vectors and matrices
at that time) was introduced. In version 2.7, the user-defined functions
of the interpreter and calculator through file interpreter were also enabled.
<p>Novelties have been introduced regularly since summer 1997. The basis
for parallelization was built by October 1997. Syntax checker and debugger
were developed by April 1998. The system of user-defined variables was
changed so that every variable could hold a whole table of elements with
arbitrary dimensions. Status of pre-defined variables has also changed
in the sense that their treatment became more similar to the treatment
of user-defined variables. Scalar variables were introduced and took over
a part of the function of calculator variables. Treatment of files was
unified with the treatment of other user-defined global variables.
<p>Summer 1998 was partially spent in adapting parts of the programme to
conceptual changes, which accumulated in the last year. Beside that, a
general file interface was developed by July. This interface on principle
enables connection of the shell with any simulation programme without adapting
the shell's source code.
<p>By August 1998, an interface for reading and replacing fields in Elfen
input and output files was constructed. Primary function of this was to
support shape optimization. In the rest of 1998 additional functionality
in variable handling has been gradually added, which finished by version
3.0 in February 1999.
<p>In the first part of 1999 the development was concentrated to fit requirements
of current practical applications and many utilities were developed for
this aim. Among the others, string manipulation was added and the general
file interface was improved. This ended in September 1999 with version
3.5. In this period many activities were undertaken in the scope of preparation
for wider use of <i>Inverse</i>. Manuals as well as demonstration and training
examples were supplemented, and the programme home page was extended to
carry out user support.
<p>Extensive code cleaning was accomplished in September and October. Some
bugs and awkwardness fixations and some simplifications and unification
were carried out. After that, utilities for manipulating the file system
and for time handling were added, following common needs arising from specific
applications. This led into version 3.6 prepared in October.
