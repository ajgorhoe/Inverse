<a name="purpose">What is the purpose of the INVERSE Users Board??</a><p>
Purpose of setting up the INVERSE Users Board was to establish a communication
between all the users of INVERSE optimisation shell. <p><hr><p>

<a name="participate">Who can participate?</a><p>
Everybody who works with the program and encounters a problem can ask for help
from our support and of course other users through the INVERSE Users Board. <p><hr><p>


<a name="links">Can I put html tags in my posts?</a><p>
Yes. You can use HTML tags like links, e-mail addresses etc.  <p><hr><p>

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>

<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload 
the page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and 
it should then appear. <p><hr><p>

<a name="search">Why didn't I get any search results?</a><p>
On our Inverse users board a very simple search algorithm is used. It just searches
for the sequence of characters that you type into the search input box. Our suggestion
is to search for just one keyword at the time. <p><hr><p>
