&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of <i>Inverse</i> is to have a
programme
suitable for solving a wide range of optimization and inverse problems
in different environments. The programme should have a flexible
structure
and user interface so that it could be utilised for solving a great
variety
of problems. It should be easily connected with different simulation
programmes
and other external programmes specialised for solving individual
subproblems.
It should provide a basic scheme for definition of optimization
problems
and specification of the solution strategy. In this framework there
should
be a growing set of algorithms and tools, which could be employed in
problem
solution.

  <h2>
  <a name="specific"></a><font color="#cc0000">What is specific for <i>Inverse</i></font></h2>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Inverse</i> is a programming shell designed for
solving
optimization and inverse problems in connection with an analysis
programme.
The analysis programme must be capable of simulating the behaviour of
structures
or parts under operating conditions, the course of processes or
experiments,
etc., which are to be optimized. The shell and the analysis programme
together
form an optimization system such as shown in <i>Figure 1.</i> The <a
 href="http://www.isr.umd.edu/Labs/CACSE/FSQP/fsqp.html"><i>FSQP</i>
algorithm</a> is used as the shell's basic optimization engine.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Main interaction points between user and the
system
are shell's command file and output file. User defines the problem and
its solution procedure by writing the command file which is interpreted
by shell's file interpreter. When the problem is being solved, the
shell
prints reports about its actions to its output file.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User of the system typically defines a skeleton
of
the direct problems that are successively solved during the
optimization
process by the simulation programme. The optimization problem and the
solution
strategy are defined through the shell's command file. To ensure high
flexibility
at defining various problems, the command file syntax resembles a high
level programming language. All necessary supporting utilities like
optimization
algorithms, function definition facilities, mathematical tools
(function
approximation, matrix operations, etc.) and interfacing with the direct
simulation, are provided through the pre-defined shell interpreter
functions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the optimization procedure, simulations
are
successively run at different values of parameters (design parameters
in
the case of optimization or model parameters in the case of inverse
problems)
to evaluate values and derivatives of the objective functions and
constraints
and eventually some other necessary data. The exact way how an
individual
analysis is performed is also defined in the command file, in an
argument
block of the "analysis" function. Each time the optimization algorithm
(or some other supporting algorithm) requires evaluation of the
objective
function (or some other data bound by direct analysis), this block is
interpreted.
All functionality of the shell is available to the user for defining
the
way how the simulation is performed and how the connected data required
by optimization algorithms is evaluated. Typically function of the
interface
between the shell and the simulation programme are used for this
purpose,
as well as some data manipulation and mathematical functions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Structure of the optimization system is shown in
<i>Figure</i>
2. Solution procedure is controlled by the command file interpreted by
shell's interpreter. Commands (or functions) in this file trigger
appropriate
actions associated with them. Command arguments determine exactly how
these
actions will be performed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important functions are those associated
with built-in optimization and other algorithms. Common to these
algorithms
is that they require successive evaluation of objective functions and
other
data bound with the simulation at different values of parameters. This
is always performed by a special function which is built in the shell.
This function among the other triggers the interpretation of the
"analysis"
command argument block where user defines how the direct analysis is
performed.
This includes the way how input data for a simulation is set or updated
according to parameter values, how the simulation is performed and how
the data required by algorithms is evaluated using the simulation data.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside file interpreter's functions which perform
run algorithms and interface functions there are a lot of other
functions
which help the user to define the problem and its solution strategy.
These
functions enable the shell to interact with system environment, keep
results
of performed algorithms and use them as input data for other
algorithms,
perform various operations on the data, including basic mathematical
operations,&nbsp;
etc. All this is controlled through the interpretation of the command
file
written by user. Syntax of the command file enables not only sequential
execution of built-in tools, but also flow control. All the data which
at a given moment exists in the shell (i.e. was generated by shell's
actions)
can be used in loop and branching conditions or as arguments to
interpreter's
functions. This gives great flexibility to the system because there is
unlimited exchange of the data between different functional units of
the
shell.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Figure 3</i> is a simple presentation of the
main
data flows in the optimization system. Data exchange between the shell
and the simulation programme can be performed through the simulation
input
and output files, however this arrangement can be replaced by a direct
interface. In this case, the shell and the simulation programme are
typically
integrated in one programme and exchange date directly by accessing
each
other's memory (sketched by the two sided arrow in the figure). The
shell
incorporates a general file interface by which it can interface any
simulation
programme which can use text file input and output. Of course, direct
interface
is more convenient because it is faster and because what happens in the
simulation programme can be better controlled by the shell.
