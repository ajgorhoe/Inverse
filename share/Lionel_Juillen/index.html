<p><br><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#CC0000">Dear Lionel
Juillen,</font></font></b>
<p>please click on <a href="ighome.zip">this link</a> to download your
<i>Inverse</i> demo. It is valid till 20th of March 2003.
<p><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Answers to your questions:</font></b>
<br><b>Q:</b>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I am interested in getting
a Windows demo version.</font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>At that time, I don't
need the FSQP algorithm from Andre Tits.</font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I just want to test the
parameterizing functionnalities because we</font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>waste too much time on
that task.</font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>Do you plan to make a
version of INVERSE, where it would be possible to</font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>plug its own optimization
algorithm ?</font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>It would make your software
more opened to the world !!!!!</font></font></i>
<br><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-1>I read your Phd thesis,
and found it very interesting and well written.</font></font></i>
<br><b>A:</b>
<br>It is already possible to plug in own optimisatin algorithms, but unfortunately
the instructions for using the relevant library have not been written yet.
<i>Inverse</i> is designed as an open code where all basic functionality
can be accessed through appropriate library functions and any kind of functionality
can be added, too. Because of insufficient development resources, manuals
have been written only for using the program as-is, and not yet for using
the <i>Inverse</i> library. In my current projects there is not much space
for writing these manuals, so I can not forecast when they will actually
be written. When there exists a strong enough interest on the side of some
of our partners, the priority list can also be accommodated and specific
things can be done earlier. Within our group I currently teach people how
to link other code with <i>Inverse</i> by myself.
<br>Parametrization ability is limited on what is offered by programme
interfaces and on processing abilities which enable definition of more
complex functionals on basis of data obtained from the direct analysis
(e.g. using the expression evaluator or matrix and vector utilities). More
elaborated interface is currently available only for <i>Elfen</i> (a FEM
simulation program developed by <i>Rockfield Software</i>). For interfacing
other programs the general file interface can be used.
<br>Shape parametrisation utilities are not yet included, except some splines
manipulation functions, which can be useful for 2D shape optimisation (instructions
for using&nbsp; this are not contained in the latest web manuals, but you
can download the PostScript version by clicking on <a href="invshape.ps">this
link</a>).
<br>I am currently developing a 2D and 3D shape parametrisation approach,
which would be quite general and also compatible with sensitivity analysis
requirements. I expect that 2D shpe parametrisatin module will be built
in the shell by the end of this year. 3D modul should be available in a
year and a half. You can find some basic ideas of the approach in the following
article (<a href="esa01c.pdf">click here to download it</a> in the pdf

<p><br><b><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installation and running instructions:</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
Unpack the directory contained in the zip file which you have downloaded
by clicking on the link. The unpacked directory&nbsp; is named <i>ighome</i>.
You can put this directory anywhere you want or rename it, but do not change
its structure or delete files contained in it.</li>

<li>
After unpacking the directory, set the environment variable <i>IGHOME</i>
to hold the directory path (e.g. if you have unpacked the directory to
"C:\Program Files\ighome", then this must be the value of the variable
<i>IGHOME</i>).&nbsp; On MS Windows you can usually set the environment
variables by invoking the Control Panel (Windows menu <i>Start/Settings/Control
Panel</i>) and double-clicking the <i>System</i> icon. In the window which
appears, you choose the <i>Environment</i> box. In the <i>Variable</i>
entry at the bottom you input <i>IGHOME</i> and in the <i>Value</i> entry
the appropriate directory name (note that if the directory name contains
spaces, it must be in double quotes).</li>

<li>
If you want to run the program from any directory, you can add the <i>bin</i>
subdirectory of the unpacked directory to the <i>Path</i> variable. You
can do this by choosing the <i>Path</i> variable in the <i>System variables</i>
menu in the same <i>Environment</i> box where you have set the <i>IGHOME</i>
variable. You can also copy the program <i>inverse.exe</i> from the bin
directory to any directory which is already contained in the <i>Path</i>
variable or run the program every time by using the complete path of the
executable. The location of executable doesn't matter, but for proper function
there must exist a program resource directory with appropriate structure
and its name must be the value of the environment variable <i>IGHOME</i>.</li>
</ol>
You can <b>run the program</b> e.g. by typing
<blockquote><i>inverse com_filename</i></blockquote>
where <i>com_filename</i> is the name of the command file in which you
give the program instructins what to do. Syntax and available commands
for the command file are described in <a href="http://www.c3m.si/inverse/doc/man/index.html"><i>Inverse</i>
manuals</a> and in <a href="http://www.c3m.si/inverse/doc/other/index.html">other
documentation</a> , e.g. the <i>Quick Introduction to Inverse</i>. You
can first try to run some <a href="http://www.c3m.si/inverse/learn/train/ex/exind.html">training
examples</a>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will get some help by invoking the program by
<blockquote><i>inverse -h</i></blockquote>
This will not be of much use, however, because the help system is not yet
elaborated. If you don't get help in this way, you should set a valid path
to a html browser (e.g. <i>Netscape</i>) in the file $<i>IGHOME\scripts\browse.bat</i>
and a path to a text editor (e.g. <i>Notepad</i>) in the file $<i>IGHOME\scripts\edit.bat</i>
